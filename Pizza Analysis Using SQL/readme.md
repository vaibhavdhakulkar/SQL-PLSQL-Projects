# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis using SQL
## 📌 Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing a pizza sales dataset using SQL to extract meaningful business insights.
The objective is to practice and demonstrate SQL skills ranging from basic queries to advanced analytical queries such as joins, aggregations, revenue analysis, and cumulative trends.

## The project answers real-world business questions related to:
- Total sales and revenue
- Customer ordering behavior
- Popular pizza types and sizes
- Time-based order distribution
- Category-wise performance
- Revenue contribution and trends

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used:
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite compatible queries)
- Relational Database (multiple tables: orders, order_details, pizzas, pizza_types)
- Aggregate Functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- JOIN operations
- GROUP BY & HAVING clauses
- Window Functions (for cumulative revenue)

## 🗂 Database Tables Used:
- orders – Order date and time information
- order_details – Quantity and pizza IDs per order
- pizzas – Price and size details
- pizza_types – Pizza name and category
- These tables are connected using primary and foreign keys and queried using JOINs.

## 🎯 Objectives:
- Perform data exploration using SQL
- Analyze sales and revenue performance
- Identify customer preferences
- Practice SQL joins and aggregations
- Generate business insights from raw data
- Build an interview-ready SQL project
